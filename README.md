This course is intended to teach the basics of running Nextflow pipelines on the LMB Computer CLuster.  Although the material refers to the setup at the MRC-LMB (in Cambridge, UK), the general concepts are applicable to a multiplicity of different setups. The course comprises 5 sections:

1.	[Next-generation sequencing – a brief overview of NGS technologies and the associated file types.](1_Next_generation_sequencing.md)
2.	[Nextflow Bioinformatics Pipelines – running complex bioinformatics pipelines, such as those available from nf-core](2_Nextflow_Bioinformatics_Pipelines.md)

The course slides (presentation.md), exercises and answers are also available here.  The slides are rendered using MARP (https://marp.app).
